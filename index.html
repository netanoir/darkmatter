                        <p>a master baited his slave, quietly.</p>

                        “For the slave, there was little that was humorous about his bondage. The conditions under which he was forced to survive were not calculated to evoke laughter, nor did the knowledge that his very soul was measured in dollars bring forth any waves of
                        merriment. The very laws of the land proclaimed him a chattel, equal to the domestic animals which he tended.”<sup>2</sup></p>
                    <p>You see, the master,</p>
                    <p>he is wise and shrewd as a manager in chief</p>

                    <p>You see, the story of the master and the slave lies in everything people say and do.</p>
                    <p>The master/slave relationship has been used for centuries in technology, often to explain situations where one master process or component controls a slave process or component.</p>
                    <p>In audio recording, duplication is done with several tapes or recorders linked together. Operating the controls on the master recording triggers the same controls or commands on the slaves so that the recording is done in parallel.</p>
                    <p>In photography, slave flash units may be synchronized to the master to provide light from other directions.
                    </p>
                    <p>In transportation, railway locomotives can be arranged in a master/slave configuration with the operation of all locomotives in the train slaved to the controls of the first master locomotive.</p>
                    <p> In automobile engineering, the master cylinder is a control device that converts force into hydraulic pressure in the brake system. The device controls slave cylinders located at the other end of the hydraulic system.
                    </p>
                    <p>In software engineering, programmers upload code to the <a href="https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin/issues/113">master branch repository</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>In computers, the master clock provides time signals used to synchronize one or more slave clocks as a part of a clock network.</p>
                    <p>The computer holds the memories of time.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>We want freedom. We want power to determine the destiny of our Black Community.</li>

                        <li>We want an end to the robbery by the <span class="bold">Capitalists</span> of our Black Community.
                        </li>
                        <li>We want decent housing, fit for shelter of human beings.</li>
                        <li>We want education for our people that exposes the true nature of this decadent American society. We want education that teaches us our true history and our role in the present day society.</li>
                        <li>We want all Black people to be exempt from military service.</li>
                        <li>We want an immediate end to <span class="bold">POLICE BRUTALITY</span> and <span class="bold">MURDER</span> of Black people.</li>
                        <li>We want freedom for all Black people held in federal, state, county and city prisons and jails.</li>
                        <li>We want all Black people when brought to trial to be tried in court by a jury of their peer group or people from their Black Communities, as defined by the Constitution of the United States.</li>
                        <li>We want land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice and peace.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Because of its practice of armed self-defense against police, as well as its communism, the Black Panther Party was frequently targeted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s COINTELPRO (a syllabic abbreviation named after the Counter
                        Intelligence Program) in addition to state and local law enforcement groups. While the Black Panther Party was targeted for its militancy, they also provided free breakfast for school children, sickle cell anemia health screenings,
                        legal aid and adult education, among other community services.</p>

                    <p>Unix is technology that exists inside most—if not all, human made computers on earth.
                        <p>The Unix philosophy established a set of cultural norms for making software that became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself.</p>
                        <p>According to this philosophy, the operating system should provide a set of simple modular tools, each of which performs a limited, well-defined function. </p>
                        <p>The 17 points of the Unix philosophy are:</p>
                        <ol>

                            <li><span class="bold">Separation</span> Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.

                            <li><span class="bold">Simplicity</span> Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Parsimony</span> Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Transparency</span> Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier.
